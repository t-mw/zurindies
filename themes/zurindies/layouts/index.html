    <h2>What is zürindies?</h2>
    <p>
      We’re a group of people working on their own game-related projects, meeting up for casual co-working on Saturdays in Zürich. Come to make some progress, get feedback on your project, or just have a chat!
    </p>
    <p>
      We normally meet at <a href="https://www.auer.coffee/">Café Auer</a> from 1pm onwards, but check <a href="https://www.twitter.com/zurindies">@zurindies</a> or the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/zurindies">meetup</a> page for the latest. To find us, look for the gamepad on the table.
